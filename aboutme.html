        <h2 class="aboutmepage">About Me</h2>
            <p>From a young age I have been an explorer, when some people read novels, I read at Atlases. Looking at the maps made me curious, thinking about what the cities and countries looked like, what the people were like.<br><br>
            As I grew older, my curiosity increased, I guess there is only so much looking at maps and pictures of the internet that one can take?! I began travelling with when I received a real treat, a family holiday to North America and Europe in 1997<br><br>
            Since that first trip, I continued to travel throughtout the world, meeting many new people and making new friends along the way. I was lucky to be given the chance to get a job at a travel agency. Years went by, roles changed, I even lived in another country for a short period.<br><br>
            This sense of exploration can also be said on my working life. As an outgoing person I have always wanted to learn and grow, I quote from an boss and friend: "You'll enjoy your new course, just be the sponge that you are!". That is when I decided to venture on a new path to learn about Web Development.<br><br>
            There has been many challenges throughout my life and at the end of each challenge, I believe I have come out a stronger person. I am keen to progress in this new and ever changing world. I look forward to tackling the new challenges that lie ahead (or do I? Ha ha)
        </p>
        <h2 class="aboutmepage">A little more about me...</h2>
            <p>Did you want to know a little more about me? I think I heard you say that! You may come out of this thinking I am either, funny, great or maybe even just a weirdo!<br><br>
            Truth be told, I am just a general person, different from you, yes. But I am just trying to enjoy this life. I come from a great family, with 2 sisters, 3 nephews and 1 niece, I love them dearly. When I moved away to London for a short-period it was particulary hard being away from the family.<br><br>
            I enjoy many other things other than travelling, I guess you can say I am an eclectic person. My friendships are very important to, just as my family and my friends and I always try out something new on our catch-ups! 
            You'll probably find me in a cafe, at restaurant, enjoying a pint (or two, or three...) at bar, trying to make up for guilty pleasures by hiking, relaxing at the beach or even in the car on a long road trip, let's just say 150km just doesn't cut the mustard!<br><br>
            On the flip side of things, as much as I like all these things, I can be a home body! Nothing beats a chilled day infront of the TV, especially if it is raining!<br><br>
            So did I bore you? Well, I hope not! If you're still with me then I give you a big high-five!!!
