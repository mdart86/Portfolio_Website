        <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>From a young age I have been an explorer, when some people read novels, I looked at Atlases. Looking at the maps made me curious, thinking about what the cities and countries looked like, what the people were like.<br>
            As I grew older, my curiosity increased, there is only so much looking at maps and pictures of the internet that one can do before you just want to see it! I began travelling with my family on my first trip to North America and Europe in 1997<br>  
            Since that first trip, I continued to travel throughtout the world, meeting many new people and making new friends along the way. I was lucky to be given the chance to get a job at a travel agency. Years went by, roles changed, I even lived in another country for a short period.<br>
            My outgoing ways has pushed me through some of the many challenges through my life, at the end of each challenge, I believe I have came out stronger as I learned and grew from the experience.
        </p>
