#### The Header
The header features a title complete with a background and curved edges. Sitting behind the title is a header image
<br>
<br>

#### The Navigation Bar
The navigation bar is a single line bar with 4 titles leading to each page of the website. An active colour and bold font identifies which page you're currently on.
<br>
<br>

#### The footer
The footer is shown across all pages and shows the copyright information.
