## ABOUT THE WEBSITE

### Purpose
A comprehensive insight into me and who I am as a person, showcasing my work and study history, what got me into coding and my coding journey so far with some projects I have embarked on.
<br>
<br>

### Functionality and Features
As a portfolio website, I have kept the functionality as simple as possible with only 4 pages.<br>
A uniformed layout is noticeable across the website, the simplified layout includes:
- Header
- Navigation Bar
- Body
- Footer
<br>
<br>

#### The Header
The header features a title complete with a background and curved edges. Sitting behind the title is a header image
<br>
<br>

#### The Navigation Bar
The navigation bar is a single line bar with 4 titles leading to each page of the website. An active colour and bold font identifies which page you're currently on.
<br>
<br>

#### The footer
The footer is shown across all pages and shows the copyright information.
