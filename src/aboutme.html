            <h2 class="aboutmepage">About Me</h2>
            <p>From a young age I have been an explorer, when some people read novels, I read at Atlases. As I grew older and started to wonder what it would be like to see those places, It was time to throw away the Atlas! I began travelling in 1997 on my first family holiday to North America and Europe. Since that first trip, I was hooked! I have meet many new people and made some great friends along the way.<br><br>
            Years went by, careers changed, even getting a job in Travel, I also lived in another country for a short period of time<br><br>            
            Come just recently, I wanted to try something new, it's in my nature to learn and grow. I quote from an boss and friend: "You'll enjoy your new course, just be the sponge that you are!". That is when I decided to venture on a new path to learn about Web Development.<br><br>
            There have been many challenges throughout my life and at the end of each challenge, I believe I have come out a stronger person. I am keen to progress in this new and ever changing world. I look forward to tackling the new challenges that lie ahead (or do I? Ha ha)

            <h2 class="aboutmepage">A little more about me...</h2>
            <p>Did you want to know a little more about me? (I think I heard you say that)! You may come out of this thinking I am either funny, great or maybe even just a weirdo!<br><br>
            Truth be told, I am just trying to enjoy this life. I enjoy many things, I guess you can say I am an eclectic person. You'll probably find me in a cafe, at restaurant, enjoying a pint (or two, or three...) at bar, trying to make up for guilty pleasures by hiking, relaxing at the beach or even in the car on a long road trip, let's just say 150km just doesn't cut the mustard!<br><br>
            On the flip side of things, as much as I like all these things, I can be a home body! Nothing beats a chilled day infront of the TV, especially if it is raining!<br><br>
            So did I bore you? Well, I hope not! If you're still with me then I give you a big high-five!!! Feel free to get in <a href="contactme.html">contact with me</a>!
