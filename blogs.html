                <p>Today, I started a new chapter of my life. Ever since I have left school, I have always been curious and passionate to travel the world, to see and experience new and different things. Whilst, that will always be apart of my life and I have cherished my opportunities and the people I have met, in these times, I've decided to venture on a new track. This was something I had been considering for a while, I just had to get my ducks in a row and figure it out. Well, now I have. I have enrolled in a course to study Web Development and let's just say I am pretty excited! I now have the option to learn and develop and create some awesome things, really fueling my creative side! During the orientation today, I met some really interesting people, all from different walks of life to my own, it's great to see such diversity of people and their passion! I am looking forward to what the next year will bring and I look forward to sharing the results of my work to you! BRING IT ON!!!</p>
