                    <p>Today, I started a new chapter of my life. Ever since I have left school, I have always been curious and passionate to travel the world, to see and experience new and different things.<br><br>
                    Whilst, that will always be apart of my life and I have cherished my opportunities and the people I have met, in these times, I've decided to venture on a new track. This was something I had been considering for a while, I just had to get my ducks in a row and figure it out.<br><br>
                    Well, now I have. I have enrolled in a course to study Web Development and let's just say I am pretty excited! I now have the option to learn and develop and create some awesome things, really fueling my creative side!<br><br>
                    During the orientation today, I met some really interesting people, all from different walks of life to my own, it's great to see such diversity of people and their passion!<br><br>
                    I am looking forward to what the next year will bring and I look forward to sharing the results of my work to you!<br><br>
                    BRING IT ON!!!</p>

                <h2>Entering a new world</h2>

                    <p>A new era has begun! Months after a once in a lifetime trip around the world, I decided to shut one door and open a new door.<br><br>
                    As you have probably figured out by now, I love travel! So I thought why not pursue a career in it! Well that is what I did. I started off as a documentations clerk essentially. Preparing the travel documents for our clients hard earned holidays. I tried to just take in everything, to me double checking that everything was correct was also a way of learning more about the world of travel!<br><br>
                    It was not long after that I progressed into consultanting. At first it was quite scary, I was responsible for making sure everything went to plan for my clients! I wanted to make sure it went as smooth as possbile for them!<br><br>
                    As gained more experience, I managed much larger itineraries
